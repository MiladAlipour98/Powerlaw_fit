# Network Analysis and Power Law Fitting

This project focuses on analyzing and fitting the power law distribution to a chosen dataset from the link provided: [http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/data.htm](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/data.htm). The following tasks will be performed:

## Dataset Selection
Choose a dataset from the provided link for analysis and power law fitting.

## Degree Distribution Analysis
1. Plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the degree distribution for the selected network. Plot both in normal form and log-log form to visualize the distribution characteristics.

### Normal CDF

## Power Law Fitting
1. Fit the Power Law distribution to the PDF and CDF plots using the goodness of fit method.
2. Draw the fitted Power Law distribution along with the original data to visualize the fit quality.

## Configuration Model Network Construction
1. Follow the steps described in the book to build a network using the Configuration Model method.
2. Write the code for the different steps of this method.
3. Use the degree sequence ùëò=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3) to construct the network using the Configuration Model method.
4. Visualize the constructed network.
